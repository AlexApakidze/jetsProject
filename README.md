This project is my spin on the Jets project. I replaced Jets with Birds and put them in a bird park. The user is offered an interface where they can interact with the Bird Park in various ways.

## Lessons Learned

1. How to import data from a text file and properly assign the information. I used this data to create objects with different parameters.

2. Learned to minimize the amount of code I write in my mainMenu() portion of code.

3. How to use an interface on the correct object(s) from a list of objects.

4. Experimented with a variety of methods to eliminate input errors.
